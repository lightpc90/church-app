          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">How Can I Be Saved?</h2>
          <p>
            Salvation is God&apos;s gift of grace to all who seek Him with a
            sincere heart. If you&apos;re wondering how to be saved, the Bible
            provides a clear path. First, acknowledge that we are all sinners in
            need of God&apos;s mercy (Romans 3:23). Turn away from sin, and
            repentâ€”this means a heartfelt change of mind and direction (Acts
            3:19). Believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who died for your
            sins and rose again to give you new life (John 3:16). Confess Him as
            your Lord and Savior, surrendering your life to His will (Romans
            10:9-10). Finally, trust that through His grace, you are forgiven,
            redeemed, and welcomed into God&apos;s family. Salvation is not
            earned by works, but received by faith in Christ alone (Ephesians
            2:8-9). Take this step today and experience the transformative love
            of God in your life!
